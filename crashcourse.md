# 1 biochem

- Carbon is the foundation of biology
- Carbon has siz protons, neutrons and electrons

## Covalent Bond
- Atoms sharing electrons with each other to fill it's shells
- Use Lewis dot structures to visualize 

## Octet Rule
- need 8 electrons in the outer shell
- atoms that complete their octet will be "happy"

## Polar Covalent Bond
- Covalent bond	  that has positive and negative pole
## Non-polar Covalent Bond
- same pole
- O2

## Ionic Bond
- do not share electrongs
- donate or accpet electrons
- NACL

## Hydrogen Bond
- Bonding with hydrogen

##Summary
- Bonds have different strengths
