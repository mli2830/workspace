	Start and end on time

	Focus on conceptual understanding

	Make clear what terminology and facts must be learned

	Open to questions -- both in class (within reason) and at office
	hours

	Responsive to questions on class forums

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expectations of students

	Don't talk while other students are talking, or while I am

		If you don't go to tutorials, don't bother us about anything
		covered in tutorials

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Texts

	The primary text for this course is the lecture notes

	You will be given readings, which will be posted to AtL

	You are required to have an Ecology textbook

		Molles and Cahill, Second Canadian edition

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of presentation

	Required material will be clearly outlined in the notes

		ANS This is an answer: it was omitted from the notes for
		discussion purposes, you should probably write it in

		COMMENT This is a comment: I omitted from the notes because I
		thought it wasn't necessary for you to study.  If you write it
		in, make a note to yourself that it's a comment.

	Required terminology will be presented in {\bf bold}

	General ideas and approaches presented in class may also be required;
	you should take notes on these in your own words

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Polling

	You can obtain extra credit by responding to in-class polls

		Text from your cell phone, or answer on the web

	POLL multiple_choice_polls/gdbKrnAHZenKKuk Why are you taking this class?

TSS Learning goals

	Ecology and population ecology

	Quantitative thinking

	Dynamical modeling

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	POLL free_text_polls/GAwCN5eA9OpPe3R What is ecology?

	My answer

		ANS The study of how organisms interact with each other and with
		the environment

		ANS Ecology is not environmentalism 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	POLL free_text_polls/6x6QEYmAsSIH1He What is population ecology?

	My answer

		ANS The study of how organisms interact with each other and with
		the environment at the population scale

		ANS Larger spatial scale, longer temporal scale

		ANS We use models to link from the individual level to the
		population level

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical modeling

BC

	Investigates the links between local, short-term processes, and
	large-scale, long-term outcomes

	Allows us to explore what assumptions we're making, and how
	assumptions affect the link

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Math

	Population ecology uses math

		Math is a critical tool for linking processes to outcomes

		Math will play a central role in the course 

	We will keep it {\em simple}

		But we understand that simple does not always mean easy

	MATREF math.handouts.pdf Review the math supplement

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Humans and abstract thought

BC

	People are evolved to be concrete thinkers, not conceptual thinkers

	A goal of this course is to build conceptual thinking skills

SS Examples

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Malaria 

BC

	A nasty, mosquito-borne disease

	In some places (e.g., the southeastern US), it has been eradicated
	almost by accident

		Mosquitoes are still present

	In other places it persists at high levels despite concerted
	efforts at elimination 

	\emph{What factors determine when and where malaria spreads?}

Red squirrels

BC

	Red squirrels are rapidly disappearing from England

		Loss of suitable habitat?

		Competition from gray squirrels introduced from North America?

		Diseases carried by gray squirrels?

Dandelions

BC

	Start with one dandelion; it produces 100 seeds, of which only
	4% survive to reproduce.

		How many dandelions after 3 years?

			ANS 64?

			ANS 125?
